              The purpose of a freight truck is to transport goods from one
              location to another, but not all trucks qualify to carry certain
              merchandise. Oversized items, hazardous materials and temperature
              sensitive cargo requires experienced handling from specialized
              trucks.

              workers to get an insight of how it is like to transport unique
              merchendise.

              <p>
                My name is Adomas Zepciukas, I am 48 years old. My nationality
                is Lithuanian, and I have been a resident in Norway for 18 years
                now.

              <h3>- How did you decide to be a truck driver?</h3>
              <p>
                I wanted to be truck driver ever since i was little. I loved to
                drive and repair cars, so to be able to do all those things, but
                also get paid well, so I though that truck driving is the best
                option

              <h3>
                - How long have you been working in the transportation industry?
              </h3>
              <p>
                I got my truck driving license in 2012 and soon after in 2014 I
                got a job at Graarud spesialtransport.

              <h3>- Can you describe a typical work day?</h3>
              <p>
                I wake up at 4 in the morning. It takes around 20 minutes to
                drive to work and get my truck, so I leave for my first trip at
                5. On an average day I do 3 back and forth trips to Oslo, that
                is around 600km and I am home by 6pm.

                long hours on the road?
              </h3>
              <p>
                What helps me get through the day is being able to come back
                home to my family and my dog. I try to take my dog out to the
                near by woods to get some fresh air, but sometimes I am gone for
                longer periods and are unable to do so every evening.

              <p>
                Currently, I am driving a Volvo, but will soon get a new Scania
                truck. Our trucks are specialized for big cargo, meaning that
                they are longer and can hande large loads.I love to personalize
                it and make it more homey. Our company paints the trucks with
                famous movie characters and allow us to improve the enterior as
                we like.

                - What are the biggest challenges you face as a truck driver?
              </h3>
              <p>
                The biggest challenge is to navigate and find the best roads to
                take with big loads. There have been a couple of times where I
                had to cut tree branches that were blocking a very narrow cuntry
                road.

                If they are thinking of taking on specialized freight truck job,
                they need to know that it is a really responsible task. You need
                to have pacience and deal well with stressful situations.
